# Event Correlation System

## Introduction
The Event Correlation System is designed to process and correlate events from various upstream systems. It leverages Apache Kafka for event streaming and uses EDF (Event Data Framework) for event storage and retrieval. This documentation outlines the system architecture, data flow, configuration, and usage.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java 11+
- Kafka 2.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+

### Installation
#### Using Package Manager
```bash
# For example, if using Maven
mvn install ...
Building from Source
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/event-correlation-system.git
cd event-correlation-system
mvn clean install
```

## Architecture
#### Components
- Other Upstreams: External systems that generate events.
- EDF Topic: Kafka topic where events are published.
- EDF Service: Service that processes events according to EDF standards.
- EDF Database: Storage for events processed by the EDF Service.
- Event Orchestration Service: Core component that manages event processing and correlation.
- Correlation Store: Database storing correlation configuration and results.
- Correlation API: API for interacting with correlation configurations and results.

#### Component Diagram

Each component is described in detail below:

- Other Upstreams: These systems generate events that are published to the EDF topic.
- EDF Topic: A Kafka topic that acts as a buffer for incoming events.
- EDF Service: Processes events from the EDF topic and stores them in the EDF Database.
- EDF Database: Stores raw and processed event data.
- Event Orchestration Service: Pulls events from the EDF topic, processes them based on stored configurations, and stores results in the Correlation Store.
- Correlation Store: Stores configurations and correlated event results.
- Correlation API: Provides endpoints for managing and retrieving correlation data.


##### Data Flow

### Flow Diagram

### Step-by-Step Flow Description
- Event Generation: Events are generated by various upstream systems.
- Event Publication: These events are published to the EDF Kafka topic.
- Event Processing by EDF Service:
- The EDF Service consumes events from the EDF topic.
- Events are processed according to EDF rules and stored in the EDF Database.
- Orchestration Service:
- Consumes events from the EDF topic.
- Uses stored configurations from the Correlation Store to correlate events.
- Correlation results are stored back in the Correlation Store.
### API Interaction:
The Correlation API allows users to interact with correlation configurations.
Users can query correlated event data and manage configurations.
Configuration
Configuration Files
config.yaml: Main configuration file for the system.
kafka.bootstrap.servers: Kafka broker addresses.
kafka.topic: Kafka topic name.
db.connection.string: Database connection string for EDF and Correlation stores.
##### Sample Configuration
yaml

kafka:
  bootstrap.servers: "localhost:9092"
  topic: "edf-topic"

db:
  edf.connection.string: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/edf"
  correlation.connection.string: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/correlation"
#### Using the Component
Starting the Services
Start Kafka:
bash

kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
Start EDF Service:
bash

java -jar edf-service.jar --config config.yaml
Start Event Orchestration Service:
bash

java -jar event-orchestration-service.jar --config config.yaml
Interacting with the API

Check System Status:

Copy code
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/status
Query Correlated Events:

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/correlations


##### Troubleshooting


#########Common Issues
- Kafka Connection Error: Ensure Kafka is running and the bootstrap.servers configuration is correct.
- Database Connection Error: Verify the database connection strings and ensure the databases are accessible.
  - Solutions
    - Kafka Connection Error:
      Check Kafka server status.
      Validate network connectivity to Kafka brokers.
      Database Connection Error:
Ensure the database server is running.
Verify credentials and network access.
